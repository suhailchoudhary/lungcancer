Lung cancer detection using Convultional neural network
Breif description: The lung cancer is caused in more than 80% people because of smoking , it harms the cell of lung 
it has three category -> Adenocarcinoma (ACA) cell: most common type about 50% people , due to both smoking and non-smoking  and spread slowly in the outer region cells.
                      -> Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC): about 25-30% people suffering because of this and mainly caused due the smoking only, spread faster than aca in the inner region.
                      -> Normal cell: the lung cells aren't associated with cancer.
Why 3 category ?
 because if a person consumes the drugs associated with scc or aca that is cross intake of medicine , that can lead to very harmful effect on human being.
You can use the this sourcecode to create the model for detecting the cancerous cell in the lung 
Steps:
1. open the repository in your text editor.
2. create the virtual environment.
3. install the necessary library requires , using the command pip install module_name.
4. create the folder name templates , add the anotherindex.html files to it.
5. Download the dataset for lung cancer images from kaggle which is already highly aumgment using the link "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images".
6. now extract the dataset
7. save the lung_image_sets from the lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images to the main folder of your project.
8. now run the the sourceccode in terminal.
9. the model "cancer_model_lung.h5" in the folder will be saved after the complete execution of sourcecodes.py.
10. now use the command in cmd "python app.py"
11. use the server link to open the webapp.
12. now upload the image from the dataset and check the result.
Hence, you have successfully run the model for lung cancer detction using CNN.
